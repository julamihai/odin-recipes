  <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>3 pounds beef tripe (cleaned as mentioned in notes and cut into small 1 inch pieces.)</li>
    <li>1 piece beef bone</li>
    <li>2 large carrots (peeled)</li>
    <li>3 stalks celery (or 1 celery root)</li>
    <li>1 large onion (peeled and left whole)</li>
    <li>1 parsnip (peeled)</li>
    <li>10 cups water</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>A little hisory: </strong></p>
  <p>Every cow has four stomachs or to be more precise, four chambers of one large digestive system. Tripe is the stomach lining of the first three of these stomachs (or chambers).</p>
  <p>It is carefully washed to remove all undigested plant matter and then is cooked in this soup to provide a unique taste. Despite the fact that some people consider “cooked stomach material” to be unpleasant, it really isn’t fundamentally different from cooking and consuming other parts of the cow for meat (assuming you eat meat).</p>   
  <p>This soup is a direct descendant of a similar Turkish soup and Romanians kept this recipe for a good reason – it’s delicious. It is a ciorba, which is a very “thin” soup, mostly all broth. It has a high fat content mixed in with a delicately balanced sour component</p>
